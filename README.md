### Three.js: 
A cross-browser JavaScript library/API used for creating and displaying 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
### enable3d:

### React Shooting Scene
In the React shooting scene, the user takes control of a character in a thrilling shooting game. The scene leverages the interactive capabilities of React to create a dynamic gaming experience. The enable3d library enhances the graphics and physics, making the shooting scene visually stunning and immersive. Will you be able to defeat React?

Users can navigate through the game world, collecting coins, overcoming obstacles, and facing challenges. The combination of React, Three.js, and enable3d enables the creation of a rich and enjoyable gaming experience.
